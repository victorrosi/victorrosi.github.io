## About

Heya, My name is Victor! üò∏

I'm a researcher operating in the fields of timbre and speech cognition. My main interests lie in the essential aspects that shape the identity of the human voice. Currently, I employ acoustic analysis and signal processing techniques coupled with statistical modelling and machine learning methods to unravel the multiple processes underlying the perception and production of vocal identity, including social traits, geographic origins, and gender. 

In the near future, my main focus will be to explore the acoustic dimensions that contribute to gender diversity as expressed through speech, with the aspiration of developing a voice coaching tool for trans and non-binary people. 

Furthermore, in line with my [PhD thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03994903/document) _The Metaphors of Sound_, I seek to explore metaphorical sound concepts, their acoustic portraits and their associated mental representations.

Alongside my academic activities, you can find me playing with orchestras as a trumpet player or hiking in mountains üèûÔ∏è.
